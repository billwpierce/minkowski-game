  <center><h6><font color="white" face="verdana">In special relativity, we’re most interested in how stuff happens from a certain perspective. This means that in our spacetime graph, that perspective will always be represented by a line going vertically up, since a thing is always distance 0 away from itself. Now, say we have the graph of an object moving away at some velocity, and we want to switch the perspective of the graph to that of the object’s. How can we manipulate the axes of the graph so that the object’s trajectory goes straight up? There are a few ways we could go about doing this, but we have to keep in mind three things: first, if the graph starts from my perspective and the object is moving v speed away from me, once we transform the graph to the object’s perspective, it should look like I am moving -v away from the object. Second, we don’t want the velocities or the distances to be messed up when doing this transformation—because changing the perspective should not change the speed that everyone is moving. Finally, it’s important that the speed of light stays the same, even when measured from different perspectives. What ends up working consistently is called Lorentz transformations. The light rays along 45° angles from the axes stay constant as we do a squeeze rotation type transformation on the graph.
